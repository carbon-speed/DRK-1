# DRK-1
The DRK-1 is a face tracking robot that is powered by the Arduino 33 IoT microprocessor. This repo records all the updates the will be performed on the robot with time.

It contains IoT capabilities and I plan on making it a desktop, PC side assistant with functionalities such as gesture recognition, and voice recognition.

This is my thesis project for my Masters in Robotics at the University of Sussex.
